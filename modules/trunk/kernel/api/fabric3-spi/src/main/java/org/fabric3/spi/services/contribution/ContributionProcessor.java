 * When a resource is indexed, only ResourceElement keys are available; their values have not yet been loaded.
 * <p/>
 * The final processing phase is when the contribution is loaded. At this point, all contribution artifacts, including
 * those in depedent contributions, are made available through the provided classloader. Indexed Resources are iterated
 * and all ResourceElement values are loaded via the loader framework. As ResourceElements may refer to other
 * ResourceElements, loading may ocurr recursively.
