package org.fabric3.spi.generator;

/**
 * Generates class loader definitions as part of a physical change set for groupings of components being provisioned to
 * a service node. Components contained in the same composite that are provisioned to a node will share the same
 * classloader. Each composite in a hierarchy will have its own classloader with a parent set to the classloader of the
 * containing composite.
 * <p/>
 * The generator introspects the logical component for a {@link org.fabric3.spi.model.type.ContributionResourceDescription}.From
 * this metadata it adds the contribution that the artifacts for the component are containined in to the classloader
 * definition. In addition, the generator adds any required extensions to the classpath by introspecting for {@link
 * org.fabric3.spi.model.type.ExtensionResourceDescription}. The classloader definition is then added to the physical
 * change set that will be sent to the service node.
 * <p/>
 * On the service node, a builder is responsible for matching the PhysicalClassLoaderDefinition to an existing
 * classloader or creating a new one. During this process, the contribution archive and required extensions may need to
 * be provisioned to the node.
 * <p/>
 * Component extension generators requiring classloader provisioning can use this service to create the required
 * classloader definition.
