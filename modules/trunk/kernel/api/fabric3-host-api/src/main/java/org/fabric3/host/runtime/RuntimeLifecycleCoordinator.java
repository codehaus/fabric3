/**
 * Implementations manage the lifecycle for a runtime type. This involves transitioning through a series of states:
 * <pre>
 * <ul>
 *      <li>BOOT PRIMORDIAL - the runtime is booted with and its domain containing system components is initialized.
 *      <li>INITIALIZE - extensions are registered and activated in the local runtime domain.
 *      <li>JOIN DOMIAN - the runtime instance discoveres and joins an application domain.
 *      <li>RECOVER - the runtime recovers and synchronizes its state with the application domain.
 *      <li>START - the runtime is prepared to receive and process requests
 *      <li>SHUTDOWN - the runtime has stopped prcessing synnchronous requests and detached from the domain.
 * </ul>
 * </pre>
 * The initialize operation is synchronous while all other operations are performed in non-blocking fashion. For non-blocking transitions, host
 * environments may choose to block on the returned Future or perform additional work prior to querying for completion.
