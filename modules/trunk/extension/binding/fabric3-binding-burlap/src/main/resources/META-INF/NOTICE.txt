Apache Tuscany is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Web Services PMC. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized
in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

This product includes software developed by
The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).
