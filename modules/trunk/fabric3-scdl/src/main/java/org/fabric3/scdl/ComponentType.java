/**
 * <p>The definition of the configurable aspects of an implementation in terms of the services it exposes, the services
 * it references, and properties that can be used to configure it.</p> <p>A service represents an addressable interface
 * provided by the implementation. Such a service may be the target of a wire from another component.</p> <p>A reference
 * represents a requirement that an implementation has on a service provided by another component or by a resource
 * outside the SCA system. Such a reference may be the source of a wire to another component.</p> <p>A property allows
 * the behaviour of the implementation to be configured through externally set values.</p> <p>A component type may also
 * declare that it wishes to be initialized upon activation of the scope that contains it and may specify an order
 * relative to other eagerly initializing components. For example, an implementation that pre-loads some form of cache
 * could declare that it should be eagerly initialized at the start of the scope so that the cache load occured on
 * startup rather than first use.</p>
