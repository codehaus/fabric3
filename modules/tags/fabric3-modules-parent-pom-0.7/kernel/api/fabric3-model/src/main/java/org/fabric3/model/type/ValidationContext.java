 * Context for gathering the results of model validation.

 * The context allows both errors and warnings to be gathered. Errors indicate problems that will definitely prevent the model object from being
 * activated such as a missing implementation. Warnings indicate issues that are not in themselves fatal but which may result in an activation
 * failure. For example, a composite service may promote a component that it does not contain. This is likely to be an error but would successfully
 * activate if the component was defined by another composite that included this one.
