/**
 * SCA Common Annotations.
 * <p/>
 * Annotations that can be applied to Java code to provide additional meta-data about the SCA component type
 * or configuration information for the implementation container. These are common annotations that
 * are intended to provide consistent behaviour across different SCA implementation types but you should consult
 * the documentation on each implementation type for a definition of how the annotation will be interpreted.
