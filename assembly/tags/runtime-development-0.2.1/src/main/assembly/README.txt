The development runtime provides a rapid prototyping and testing environment
for SCA applications with minimal setup. Developers can create SCA composites
and activate (i.e. "deploy") them against a local domain from within an IDE.
The runtime contains a Domain API for activating composites and
programmatically connecting to components for testing purposes.
