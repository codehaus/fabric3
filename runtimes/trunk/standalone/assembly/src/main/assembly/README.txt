Apache Tuscany Standalone Runtime Distribution
----------------------------------------------

This distribution provides support for running SCA composites in a
standalone client environment using a client launcher. To launch
a composite run:

  $ java -jar bin/launcher.jar <yourComposite> [args ...]

The configuration for the runtime environment used by the launcher is
defined in the profiles/launcher directory.

Detailed documentation on developing applications using SCA and running
them on Apache Tuscany can be found on the project website at:
  http://incubator.apache.org/tuscany/

Alternatively questions can be sent to the mailing list at:
  mailto:tuscany-user@ws.apache.org
