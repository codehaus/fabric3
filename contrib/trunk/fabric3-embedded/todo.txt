Done
=============
- cross IDE support (not specific code)
- maven support
- selecting profiles
- single runtime
- multi runtime
- reusing maven dependency location
- posibility to specify own systemConfig file
- no profiles when none specified
- profile which include all profiles
- reduce fabric3 dependency usage (just standalone, jms, ...)
- make one place where these dependency can be reused (will replace existing reusage of maven dependency location)
- support for installing/deploying composites from classpath

Planed
==============
- support for addding extensions on runtimes
- add feature to run junit tests agains embedded server

- undeploy/uninstall composites
- redeploy composites

- add support for pointing fabric3 to existing server instance (and take extensions from)

- gradle support
- don't use maven for resolving runtime (standalone, profiles) dependencies -> create download mechanism
