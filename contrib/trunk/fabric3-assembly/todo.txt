Done
=============
- cross IDE support (not specific code)
- don't use maven for resolving runtime (standalone, profiles) dependencies -> create download mechanism
- reusing maven dependency location
- reduce fabric3 dependency usage (just standalone, jms, ...)
- single runtime
- multi runtime
- possibility to specify own systemConfig file
- support for adding extensions on runtimes
- create servers/configuration from source code

Ideas
==============
- support json configuration
- start server from source code
- add support for pointing fabric3 to existing server instance (and take extensions from)
- support for installing/deploying composites from classpath
- add feature to run jUnit tests against embedded server
- add support to define custom extensions
- unDeploy/uninstall composites
- redeploy composites
